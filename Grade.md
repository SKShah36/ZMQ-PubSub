1. Should work with all the properties mentioned in the assignment. (25)

topologies that we can create in Mininet (I might supply some topologies) (25)
3. Subscribers may join any time and leave any time (25)
4. Do end-to-end measurements (time between publication and receipt of info; since the clock
is the same on all emulated hosts, we do not have the issue of clocks drifting apart from each
other). Plot graphs and have them saved in the repo that you maintain. (25)
